- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @realdevvora
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Full-stack Web Development!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React.js, Node.js, Flask, PostgreSQL, and much more.

My more notable projects are:

- [Course Evaluations](https://github.com/realdevvora/course-evaluations)
I used the MERN stack to create this project.
- [Course Match Daddy](https://github.com/CSC207-2023Y-UofT/course-project-course-match-daddy)
This was a course project, where my group and I used Java and Android Studio.
- [Playstyle Analysis](https://github.com/realdevvora/Playstyle_Analysis)
This project was made using Django.

Be sure to check them out!
